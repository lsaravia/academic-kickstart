Roughly, this [science
paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6050/1755.abstract) suggest
that gamma diversity can explain the latitudinal/altitudinal variations
in beta diversity so there is no need to invoke different local assembly
mechanisms, they use two extensive data sets (One of them is
[here](http://ecologicaldata.org/wiki/alwyn-h-gentry-forest-transect-dataset-0)
). It seems to me that almost the same thing is formulated in the
Hubbell's neutral theory, local alfa diversity is determined by
metacommunity (regional or gamma) diversity so beta diversity will also
be determined by gamma diversity. In fact an expression for beta
diversity under the neutral model was derived and it was found
[inconsistent with
data](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/295/5555/666). But different
measures of beta diversity were used.

Therefore we can use the same dataset to estimate the neutral theory
parameters and do simulations to obtain beta diversity (a confidence
envelope). If we reject neutral theory,  the same results were obtained
previously with other data sets, so we have to discuss why. If we don't
reject neutral theory, maybe that is more interesting, also we have to
discuss why.

We can use the methods of:

[*Estimating Parameters of Neutral Communities: From One Single Large to
Several Small Samples. Ecology, 88(10),
2482-2488.*](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/07-0049.1?journalCode=ecol)

This is an open possibility for collaborations so tell me if you like
the idea and want to work with it.
