One can think of different ways that biodiversity can be regulated in the framework of food-webs or more generally networks of interactions:

- Top-down: the effect of predation, hervibory, parasitism

- Botton-up: food/nutrients

- Disturbance: 

In a more microscopic way could also have stabilizing influence or not

- Trophic interactions 

- Competitive or negative interactions

- Mutualistic or positive interactions

- No interactions (Neutral)

- Environment-species interactions

## Hypothesis: The Diversity of Interaction Types have influence on the Community Stability

The community structure effect on population dynamics may not be correctly evaluated in the absence of interaction type-mixing information

However, empirical data on hybrid community interaction webs are limited.

A possible test of our hypothesis is to compare the composition of interaction types between different communities under varying levels of disturbance. An ecosystem under more-intensive disturbance is expected to have a more stabilizing composition of interaction types.
