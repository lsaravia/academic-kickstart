I had a hard day, lots of data, many papers, many ideas crossing my mind, all ended in confusion, nothing was clear. 

I went home and my wife said why do not you take a bath?
 
Under the shower, soaping me, suddenly, everything was fixed in my head.
 
But this always happens to me, the best ideas come while I am taking a shower.
 
It looks like someone did the experiment and found the same:


[Why greater ideas come when you are not trying?](https://www.nature.com/news/why-great-ideas-come-when-you-aren-t-trying-1.10678)

(Went to bath)
...
(I come back from the bath)

The problem is that sometimes an hour passes and I am still under the shower, and I realize that because my fingers get wrinkled.
