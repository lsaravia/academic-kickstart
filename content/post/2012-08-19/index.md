This is not a sex bomb, but who knows. A couple of weeks ago I was
giving a talk at the [Escuela Argentina de Matemática y
Biología](http://www.famaf.unc.edu.ar/%7Ebiomat/escuela12/index.php)
about [neutral and non-neutral models in
ecology](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.93530). I was pointed to
the paper of  [Clark 2012 The coherence problem with the Unified Neutral
Theory of Biodiversity](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712000365)
with the commentary: the neutral theory is uninformative. 

And the paper basically says that neutral models or neutral theory is based on
ignorance and that they are incoherent.

I think this is very interesting, but I disagree, here I review the last
four points of the article:

(i) Incoherence: Neutral models assume all individuals are equal then go
on and predict things like SADs and SARs, what is this telling us about
the niche? The individuals are all equal, the species can have different
effective probabilities to reach a place, different densities, but there
is no niche. In this sense it can be thought as a null model for niches,
other kinds of null models for niche can be constructed and maybe they
are better, but I don't see incoherence.  Competition and niche are not
the only things relevant to coexistence of species.

(ii) Ignorance: I am sure we are ignorant about nature, but assuming
that all individuals are equal is not equal probability and equal
probability is not a null model for sameness. Anyway the equivalence of
individuals is certainly not ignorance is an assumption.


(iii)Victory: There are no victories here, but models or theories to
explain nature patterns and we need to confront them with data in
several ways, and much better in several ways at the same time.


(iv)Applying neutral models in conservation: you have to be careful to
apply a model to conservation practices, neutral or not neutral does not
matter at all. Models are not reality, always have simplifications,
aproximations, or assumptions and we can select which is better for our
problem (see [Model selection in ecology and
evolution](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703003458)).



The real issue I think is a matter of scale: which are the microscale
processes that determine macroscale patterns. If niche models predicts
the same patterns that neutral models and both are consistent with real
data (see [Niche and neutral models predict asymptotically
equivalent...](http://www.pnas.org/content/107/36/15821.abstract)) a
parsimonious interpretation is that we don't need niche. But if real
data does not match the model we do need to add more complexities.

I think that neutral models are usefull both intellectually and
practically, more about this in [Neutrality without incoherence: a
response to Clark](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534712000948)
