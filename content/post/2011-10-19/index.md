I don't know exactly why I chose this name for this blog, it was the
first thing that came to my mind when I thought about my own science
blog. I had blogs about poetry and short stories (in Spanish) but this
is a new challenge it was slowly forged inside me from some time ago,
this last step was inspired by a note about open science by [Carly
Strasser](http://dcxl.cdlib.org/?p=205) and by the [Oikos
blog](http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/), that was the first blog about
ecology I met. So I am a ecologist interested in biodiversity usually
working with models and data, I will try post the things that go through
my head in the process of making and learning open science. Posting will
be in English but sometimes I will post in Spanish so in any case we
have big brother's help of google translation. One more thing, I googled
the name of the blog and this note about [blue water
thinking](http://www.sviokla.com/ideas/blue-water-thinking/) appeared, I
will reproduce the first phrase. Here we go:

- *The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination. –Albert
Einstein*
