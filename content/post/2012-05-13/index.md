Ok, nobody's gonna tell you that.

But I was about to drink a relaxing glass of black wine and reading some papers, the rest of the world was sleeping.
And I found this: ["Characterizing a scientific elite: the social
characteristics of the most highly cited scientists in environmental
science and ecology"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-010-0234-4)

I like things that are not exactly as supposed to be.


How to be a successful scientist, I don't know. I don't even know if it's
important to be successful. But the really important thing is to enjoy
life. Maybe they, the successful ones, they only do that.

So I enjoyed my wine and went to sleep.
